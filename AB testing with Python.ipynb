    "In this notebook we'll go over the process of analysing an A/B test, from formulating a hypothesis, testing it, and finally interpreting results. For our data, we'll use a <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/zhangluyuan/ab-testing?select=ab_data.csv'>dataset from Kaggle</a> which contains the results of an A/B test on what seems to be 2 different designs of a website page (old_page vs. new_page).

The UX designer worked really hard on a new version of the product page, with the hope that it will lead to a higher conversion rate. The product manager (PM) told you that the **current conversion rate** is about **13%** on average throughout the year, and that the team would be happy with an **increase of 2%**, meaning that the new design will be considered a success if it raises the conversion rate to 15%.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Don't worry if you are not familiar with the above, all this really means is that whatever conversion rate we observe for our new design in our test, we want to be 95% confident it is statistically different from the conversion rate of our old design, before we decide to reject the Null hypothesis $H_0$.

    "\n",
    "This will be our *Independent Variable*. The reason we have two groups even though we know the baseline conversion rate is that we want to control for other variables that could have an effect on our results, such as seasonality: by having a `control` group we can directly compare their results to the `treatment` group, because the only systematic difference between the groups is the design of the product page, and we can therefore attribute any differences in results to the designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our *Dependent Variable* (i.e. what we are trying to measure), we are interested in capturing the `conversion rate`. A way we can code this is by  each user session with a binary variable:\n",

    "* **Power of the test** ($1 - \\beta$) - This represents the probability of finding a statistical difference between the groups in our test when a difference is actually present. This is usually set at 0.8 as a convention (here's more info on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_a_test\">statistical power</a>, if you are curious)\n",
    "* **Alpha value** ($\\alpha$) - The critical value we set earlier to 0.05\n",
    "* **Effect size** - How big of a difference we expect there to be between the conversion rates\n",
